Gone are the days where you need to run App / Web Servers using Java, .NET or PHP. You can now have both front end and back end environments in Javascript. This workshop hopes to familiarize participants with Node and Express giving you a hands on experience developing a REST API of your own."

This year, we want to work on Creating Smart Homes. With the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the ubiquitous mobile phone, the home surprisingly remains largely unchanged. We envision that through HackOMania 2018, we would be able to synergize the conveniences that tech has already given us with everyday use cases; creating solutions using machine learning and AI that would impact our everyday life at home. We had an overwhelming number of participants who joined and presented different great ideas. There was a total of 17 groups.  See more of their ideas here hackomania.geekshacking.com:8080/index.html. Thanks for all the sponsor who made this event possible."
